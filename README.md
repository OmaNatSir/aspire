**ASP.NET CORE MVC project**

The project is under work...

I planned this project as a code first project with connection to a database consisting of eight tables. I fulfilled them by running scripts in MS SQL Server Management Studio. At this moment only Bootstrap is used in client-side files. All used icons are created by Paint. See reasult of this development phase in the picture below.
